# template-mern
This is a MERN template repository designed to provide a head start for building full-stack applications using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It offers a pre-configured environment with essential setup, enabling developers to focus on writing features rather than initial boilerplate configuration.
